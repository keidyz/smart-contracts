# greedy-airdropper contract

## overview
If you've ever airdropped/sent out a token to the masses, you'd most likely know that it's not a free action. Send a token to another wallet requires processing, thus the fee that we lovingly call "transfer fee".

What if you don't want to pay the "transfer fee"?

This contract is perfect for when you're hosting an airdrop but don't want to pay for the token transfer costs and want to have the recipient cover the transfer costs on-claim instead.

AKA: The sender won't pay for anything. The receiver pays.

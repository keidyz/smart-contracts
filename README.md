This is a collection of the smart contracts I've written for more personal projects.

The tests I've made for them are also here.

They have all been lovingly ripped off of their original repositories and renamed so there might be path and name issues here.

An overview of the contracts here are
- [greedy-airdopper](https://github.com/keidyz/smart-contracts/blob/main/greedy-airdropper/README.md) - this allows people to distribute(airdrop) their tokens without paying for the transfer fees as the transfer fees will be covered by the receiver
- popular-shitcoin-token - a re-write of the original safemoon contract with more readability and better logic flow
